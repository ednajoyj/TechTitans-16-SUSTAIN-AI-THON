#  Innovating Mental Health Solutions for Educational Institutions
This project leverages artificial intelligence to provide a personalized mental health support system. Using an interactive React Native interface, users can input data that is processed through Spring Boot APIs and analyzed by Hugging Face transformers for sentiment detection. The results are stored in a real-time database or SQLite, enabling users to monitor their mental health trends via a web application.
## Key Features
<ul>
<li>Interactive User Interface: Simple, user-friendly React Native design for easy input.
<li>AI-Powered Analysis: Sentiment analysis using Hugging Face transformers.
<li>Data Management: Mood history is stored securely in a database for tracking.
<li>Web Dashboard: Visual insights to help users understand mental health patterns.
</ul>
This platform will therefore aim to support mental well-being by providing meaningful insights while also ensuring data privacy and security.

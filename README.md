#  Innovating Mental Health Solutions for Educational Institutions
This project leverages artificial intelligence to provide a personalized mental health support system. Using an interactive React Native interface, users can input data that is processed through Spring Boot APIs and analyzed by Hugging Face transformers for sentiment detection. The results are stored in a real-time database or SQLite, enabling users to monitor their mental health trends via a web application.
## Key Features
<ul>
<li>Interactive User Interface: Simple, user-friendly React Native design for easy input.
<li>AI-Powered Analysis: Sentiment analysis using Hugging Face transformers.
<li>Data Management: Mood history is stored securely in a database for tracking.
<li>Web Dashboard: Visual insights to help users understand mental health patterns.
</ul>
This platform will therefore aim to support mental well-being by providing meaningful insights while also ensuring data privacy and security.

# Solution
User-Centric Chatbot Development

A customized chatbot is developed without dependence on any external APIs to assure faster implementation as well as greater flexibility.

The user inputs are processed by the chatbot, that analyses the sentiment, and responds accordingly for mental health support assistance.

Smooth user interface and an easy interface: React Native offers a smooth user interface, letting users easily key in thoughts while still engaged in the chat and access the program on various media. Custom-built Back-end for functionality

Spring Boot is used on back-end development handling user input through the engine connecting to the backend. Machine learning-based sentiment analysis

Custom sentiment analysis is used to check the mental condition of users with the help of interpretation of text input.
This way, the evaluation could be done in real-time and personalized conversations with the chatbot can take place.
Data Management
It will maintain user interaction along with their changing moods, as well as the responses it received, which is similar to what would be fed back to help monitor users over a period
Web Application to Monitor

A web application is provided to help users gain more insight into their mental health patterns and how they interact with the chatbot.
The project will ensure that it is more personalized, efficient, and secure to the user by maintaining control over functionality and data handling with a custom-made chatbot.
